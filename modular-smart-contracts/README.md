contract MyApp {
    using BasicMathContract for uint256;
    
    function calculate() external view returns (uint256) {
        return amount.complexCalculation();
    }
}
```

### Multi-Contract Integration
```solidity
// Combine multiple contracts for enhanced functionality
contract IntegratedSystem {
    BasicMathContract public mathContract;
    AdvancedTrading public tradingContract;
    GovernanceSystem public governance;
    
    function executeStrategy() external {
        uint256 signal = mathContract.calculateSignal();
        tradingContract.executeWithSignal(signal);
        governance.recordDecision();
    }
}
```

### Massive Contract Orchestration
```solidity
// Enterprise-grade system combining all tiers
contract MassiveContract {
    // Integration of 20+ modular contracts
    // Unified interface for complex operations
    // Advanced coordination and state management
}
```
