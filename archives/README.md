# WEB3 Project Archives

This directory contains timestamped archives of all work performed on the WEB3 project. Each archive represents the state of work at a specific point in time and serves as immutable proof of development progress.

## Archive Structure

## Archive Principles

1. **Immutability**: Once created, archives are never modified
2. **Completeness**: Each archive contains full context and work state
3. **Traceability**: Clear timestamps and detailed work descriptions
4. **Organization**: Structured metadata with tags and use cases
5. **Proof of Work**: Only archive when actual development work is performed

## Usage

Archives are created automatically when significant work is completed. Each archive entry includes:

- Timestamped directory name
- Complete snapshot of repository state
- Detailed work summary and explanations
- Categorization tags and use cases
- Notes about usage and dependencies

## Sub-Archives

When archived work is referenced or used in new development:

1. Create a sub-archive under the original archive's `sub_archives/` directory
2. Include timestamp of when the work was referenced
3. Document how the archived work was used
4. Maintain link back to original archive

This ensures complete traceability of how archived work evolves and gets utilized over time.
