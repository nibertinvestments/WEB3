## 🚀 Current Development Status

**Project Status**: Active blockchain development repository with working components and contracts under development.

### What's Working Now ✅

- **Node.js Backend**: Fully functional HTTP server running on port 3000
- **Development Environment**: Complete Hardhat configuration with multi-network support
- **Repository Structure**: Well-organized contract categories and libraries
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation and guides
- **Basic Compilation**: Many contracts compile successfully with Solidity 0.8.19

### Development in Progress 🔄

- **Contract Compilation**: Some contracts have minor compilation issues being resolved
- **Test Suite**: Testing infrastructure in place, with some tests pending compilation fixes
- **Contract Integration**: Working on inter-contract compatibility and integration
- **Gas Optimization**: Ongoing optimization of contract efficiency

### Quick Verification ✨

You can immediately test the working components:

```bash
# Test the Node.js server (works immediately)
npm start
curl http://localhost:3000  # Returns: "Hello World"

# Attempt contract compilation (shows current state)
npm run compile
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
- **npm**: v8.0.0 or higher  
- **Python**: 3.8+ (for analytics)
- **Git**: Latest version

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nibertinvestments/WEB3.git
cd WEB3

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Install Foundry (optional - for advanced development)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
# Add your private keys, RPC URLs, and API keys
```

### Development Workflow

#### Using Hardhat (Primary)

```bash
# Compile contracts (some may show compilation warnings)
npm run compile

# Run tests (may have some pending compilation fixes)
npm run test

# Start local development node
npm run node

# Deploy to localhost (once compilation is resolved)
npm run deploy-localhost

# Deploy to testnet (Sepolia) 
npm run deploy-sepolia
```

#### Using Foundry (Optional - requires separate installation)

```bash
# Install Foundry separately if desired
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Build with Foundry (alternative toolchain)
forge build

# Test with Foundry
forge test
```

#### Node.js Backend

```bash
# Start the server
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000

# Check server status
curl http://localhost:3000
# Expected: "Hello World"
```
